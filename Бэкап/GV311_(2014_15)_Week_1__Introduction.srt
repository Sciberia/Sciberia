1
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:10,730
Так. Давайте начнём... Добрый вечер, приветствую вас на GV311.

2
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,200
Это первая, а если точнее - вводная неделя. Меня зовут Тони Трэверс,

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,810
я профессор на факультете Государственного управления, ответственный за курс GV311.

4
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,709
Пожалуй, перед началом стоит объяснить несколько вещей. У нас здесь стоят

5
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:30,320
камеры, которые позволят нам записать этот курс в более высоком качестве

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,540
по сравнению с тем, что мы имеем для других лекций.

7
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,620
И затем мы это смонтируем и выложим. Так что вы при желании можете

8
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,669
задавать вопросы, их мы тоже заснимем.

9
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,469
Вы также сможете найти эти лекции в Интернете и в...

10
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:52,159
т.е. просто в Интернете, и посмотреть их записи через некоторое время

11
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:53,359
после лекций.

12
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,140
Также в прошлом году мы разрешили посещать лекции людям не из университета,

13
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,460
и я заметил, что сегодня несколько таких людей здесь присутствуют.

14
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:09,200
А теперь не могли бы ребята с курса GV311 поднять руки,

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,240
чтобы не беспокоить остальных. Ага.

16
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:17,750
Хорошо...достаточно. Сейчас просто скажите свои имена

17
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,200
Это наша первая встреча

18
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,440
classes, will also then have a sense of who you are as well.

19
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,190
С ним вы увидитесь в пятницу.

20
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,190
Возможно, вы с ним уже знакомы.

21
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:36,259
Именааа

22
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,479
Имяяя

23
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,520
Продолжим (Хорошо) (Прекрасно)

24
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,869
what I want to do this week, anyways, just to introduce the course. This is like a

25
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:56,549
way of explaining what's going to be in the course over the coming...

26
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,600
Yes, sorry?

27
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,568
Yes, is that...my hope that's not a problem. And no, they will be every week, not just

28
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:09,989
this week. And that means you can watch them again.

29
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,910
We've got...I say it, embarrass my colleagues, slightly higher production

30
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,400
values than on the lecture capture, I hope.

31
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,548
Certainly it was the last year.

32
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:25,440
Anyway, what I want to do this week is simply to introduce the course. I'm very happy

33
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,300
if you want to ask a question or one or two points, and what I'm going to say,

34
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,239
well, pause where you could, join in,

35
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,970
make a comment, whatever. But I just want to go through what will be in the course

36
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:44,130
over the next 19 weeks. We've got 19 weeks straight - mixture of...I'll be doing

37
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,000
some of these lectures, we've got guest lectures for most of the other weeks,

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,620
and then we'll have a revision slot at the beginning of the summer term.

39
00:02:52,620 --> 00:03:00,300
The purpose of the course is to provide an analytical understanding of

40
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,400
the following things, aspects of the principles that underpin

41
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,919
British government and politics;

42
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:14,100
political parties, elections and representation;

43
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,578
the origins and operations of the institutions of British government -

44
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:22,410
any of these you will doubtless of...studied before, but we will take out of it

45
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:27,269
further, I hope. Some modern historical developments. How - you'll see I'll go

46
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:31,380
through this in a bit more detail in a minute - how the institutions of

47
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:37,560
government evolved. We'll be looking at the Judiciary and the court system;

48
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:46,290
the policy-making process; public finance, including taxation and expenditure;

49
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:53,180
and, of course, criticisms of all the above and at proposals for reform.

50
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,869
So that's very broadly what the lectures will be covering. Some two lectures will

51
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:02,829
cover some of these topics, one in other cases. There are things I haven't listed here,

52
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:10,510
some other themes. We'll be looking at party politics, Professor Patrick Dunleavy.

53
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,959
We will do this: the decline of mass party memberships and

54
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:20,790
Britain's move to a multi-party system - just before Christmas. And then the role of

55
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,680
the media - looking at the traditional media vs. the new media and their

56
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,300
impact within British politics. Also at ownership and regulation, their impacts

57
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:34,240
on political life. We'll have a couple of weeks on accountability and financial

58
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,300
responsibility looking at Select Committees, Parliament's more general role

59
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,739
in scrutinizing the Executive, and at possible roles and

60
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:50,259
improvements of this system. And then last but not least...well, actually, not quite

61
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:55,659
last...nearly last but not least - British government's relations with Europe.

62
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:59,530
We can't live without relationship that Britain appears to have

63
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:06,969
with Europe, and also at the spectrum from the federalism that

64
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,259
some EU countries appear to own versus the threat of withdrawal, which is Britain's

65
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:16,600
counter to that. And in fact beyond this because it seemed to be an appropriate thing.

66
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:22,659
The last lecture of next term, that is just in march, we will look at

67
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:26,469
the British general elections' past, because if you think about it that

68
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,950
lecture will run in March, just before the general election.

69
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:35,570
We have Professor Vernon Bogdanor, the great

70
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:39,830
constitutional expert, will come and talk to us about that in March. So that will be

71
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:45,409
a good lecture to end the series with. What I want to do this

72
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,910
evening is just to run through a number of these things one by one.

73
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:53,330
I'd be very happy if you want to, you know, ask a question,

74
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,500
join in, don't feel you have to, and, of course, some of these issues will be

75
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,460
picked up in classes and in more detail in the weeks ahead, so this is very much

76
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:08,180
an attempt to encapsulate everything that will be seen in the coming weeks.

77
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,630
So, I want this week to introduce a number of themes that we'll meet

78
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,350
in the weeks ahead.

79
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:17,990
British constitution or the lack of it, Parliament and the Executive, the Civil Service,

80
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:25,910
the Welfare State, Human Rights and British variants on Human Rights,

81
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:30,680
local government and centralization, devolution which has been obviously

82
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,400
a very big and hugely important issue recently.

83
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,120
You know what's interesting about the whole Scottish referendum debate,

84
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,200
which also a bit more in a moment, is that rather in the way

85
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:48,349
the economic crisis back in 2008 had the effect, as far as I could see,

86
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:52,400
of a mass public education in economics and economic theory

87
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,239
very quickly,

88
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,700
the Scottish referendum had, I think, an analogous effect in terms of teaching people

89
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,420
about the British constitution, or more to the point, about the lack of

90
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:07,670
a written constitution and, indeed, about the begging questions about the

91
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:13,130
federal nature of Britain. In a country that isn't a federal country, if that

92
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,460
doesn't sound too complicated. I mean, you know. Back to the number of serious

93
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,630
questions which we can look at in the coming weeks. And then, of course,

94
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:24,680
very briefly I want to turn to Britain and Europe. This is not everything you'll be doing

95
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,440
in the weeks ahead, just a taste of, really.

96
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:34,450
So if I can just begin with the Constitution, and as I'm sure you're all

97
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:39,580
aware Britain has a long evolved system of government and politics, I should have

98
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,630
added these slides as all others will be made available to your on Moodle,

99
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,100
so don't feel you have to write them all down, should you wish to.

100
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:50,950
A long evolved...a system of government and politics with

101
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:56,200
no written Constitution. We don't have a formal written Constitution.

102
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,630
Very few countries...of which this is true.

103
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:04,540
Notably, New Zealand and Israel, it's also true of them. But of course we do have

104
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:13,960
a large number of ad hoc, we have legislation, judicial precedents in the courts,

105
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,919
so it isn't as if there aren't constitutional principles underlying the way

106
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:23,830
Britain governs itself, but we do not have a codified Constitution.

107
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:28,990
And, of course, there are a number of commentators - actually,

108
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:29,650
a very large number,

109
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:34,597
many based within the school - who believe we should have a written Constitution in the UK.

110
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:42,640
We also have a series of institutions which have evolved out of antiquity.

111
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,330
Most obviously - the head of state,

112
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:52,150
the monarchy. Unusual...not unique in Europe by any means, but a head of state

113
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:56,200
who is a monarch, a system that has been handed down over,

114
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,900
well then you're where you start, over a thousand years and, of course,

115
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,189
a very powerful

116
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:08,800
monarchical based head of state which has remained its popularity.

117
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,810
Partly because, of course, it is cut off from formal power - doesn't mean it doesn't have

118
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,250
an influence, but cut off from formal governmental power allowing it

119
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:23,470
most of the time to remain above formal government,

120
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:28,870
and therefore has none of the disadvantages of the unpopularity

121
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,450
that politicians can court.

122
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,450
We also have a second chamber - the House of Lords,

123
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:39,370
what in other countries might be a Senate, which itself is constituted in

124
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,140
a very unusual way.

125
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:48,130
It has its origins like the monarchy...back in the mists of time;

126
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:52,990
has its origins in the aristocracy, in a particular form of...government

127
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:58,480
that involved in Britain getting on for a thousand years ago, but where today...

128
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,100
what is left the House of Lords does look unusual by international standards.

129
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,280
So it's a legislative chamber.

130
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,689
It can...legislation goes through the House of Lords as well as the House of Commons,

131
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:15,940
but in doing so there are checks written into the House of Lords,

132
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,830
for example, it can't vote on money bills and it can only delay bills, it cannot

133
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:25,390
permanently vote them down. The constitution of the Lords is remarkable

134
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:30,459
in the sense that it's now an extraordinary mixture of the hereditary

135
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:34,300
peers, who until the nineteen fifties were the only ones, so people were only in by birth,

136
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:39,819
and now have been added to them life-peers in very large number -

137
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:47,950
it's over a thousand of them in total now. But the remaining 92 hereditary peers -

138
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:54,250
think about this - when one of their...they were left after some reforms

139
00:10:54,250 --> 00:11:00,670
Labour government pushed through between 1997 and 2010. And for the remaining hereditaries,

140
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,380
of course, they sit in party groups, and when the very small groups -

141
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:10,839
liberal democrats and labor - when one of their members dies then there's a by-election

142
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:15,670
for the remaining ones to choose another one who must be a hereditary peer.

143
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:19,959
So, you know, by the great standards of global democracy this is unusual, I think

144
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:24,729
we can agree, but it's the way the House of Lords operates.

145
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:28,360
That's our second chamber and in many ways - I don't want to be over critical of it,

146
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,450
because in many ways it has a distance, it's not elected,

147
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:35,200
therefore it has a bit of distance and can occasionally discuss issues that

148
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,920
the Commons find too hard to discuss.

149
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,640
So there's been a debate in the House of Lords recently about a bill

150
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:48,560
concerning assisted dying which, I think, is the kind of bill only the Lord's

151
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,390
would really try with that degree of seriousness to look at,

152
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,710
as the Commons find it too difficult.

153
00:11:54,710 --> 00:12:01,190
So an extraordinary second chamber, because we have no formal separation of

154
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:06,170
powers in this country between the Legislature and the Executive.

155
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:10,610
Indeed, the Executive - Prime Minister and the Cabinet are derived from

156
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,930
the Legislature.

157
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,870
This is not the way it's done in many countries that have a formal separation

158
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:24,800
between these things, between these two parts of the state. And, of course, until very recently

159
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,330
the Judiciary were also appointed by the Executive will be it in

160
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:33,920
a slightly complicated way that has been reformed. We'll hear more about that from

161
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:41,209
Professor Conor Gearty later this term or early next term soon.

162
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:44,630
And as I hinted a moment ago, on top of all of this

163
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:50,990
inherited and evolved governmental arrangement - took a thousand years of it -

164
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,200
we now have Scotland and Wales, and I'll say a bit more about this in a moment,

165
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:01,160
operating as if they were fed parts of the federal system. So Scotland now

166
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,800
in many ways and soon will have the powers of an American state or a German land,

167
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,560
and yet it's actually exists purely at the whim of the House of Commons,

168
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,540
and it will be possible for Parliament to stop Scottish devolution tomorrow.

169
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:21,770
They would do that it would be impossible, but nevertheless we

170
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:25,579
have an increasingly federal system of government in a country without the Constitution,

171
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,300
which isn't any way a federal country, we're a unitary state.

172
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:36,170
There we have some pictures just to light relief at this point and two aspects,

173
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:41,270
here is a very glorious picture there of the Queen at the State Opening of Parliament.

174
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:46,310
This brings together the House of Lords, all those peers in there Herman,

175
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:51,709
and the Queen, and Prince Philip sitting on that splendid gold throne.

176
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,680
This is the House of Lords,

177
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:59,760
was not bombed between 1939 - 1945, while the House of Commons was.

178
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,510
And so this looks as it was built in the 19th century. This is a very grand event when

179
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:07,560
the Queen sits on the throne and reads the government's legislation out.

180
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,219
It's amazing, it is lucky, I suppose, that she doesn't have to show emotion,

181
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:16,230
because she read it out whoever's in government, whatever the legislation is - straight.

182
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:21,720
And this, of course, is the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition being attending -

183
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,750
and many of you will...certainly, you've seen this

184
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:32,400
if you live in Britain, will know that the House of Commons is summoned each year

185
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:37,920
to come to stand at the bar in the House of Lords, bar is not a bar.

186
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:45,870
It is a bar of that kind, where Black Rod goes to the Commons and invites

187
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:49,800
the House of Commons to attend the Lords and there

188
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,430
listen to the Queen's speech, the government speech really, and get this

189
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,430
extraordinary picture of the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition

190
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:01,109
attempting to make small talk to each other, and the Liberal Democrat leader

191
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:04,170
who is actually in the Government, of course, at the moment, just behind doing the same

192
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,660
with Harriet Harman, the Labor deputy leader.

193
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,949
So this sort of brings together the Queen...

194
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:15,890
this is the day in the year when...all of this sort of process comes

195
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:18,690
together, because it's these people really - the House of Commons - who have

196
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:24,390
the power and all of this is to varying degrees less powerful but parts of the system.

197
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:31,290
Now, in Martin Loughlin, Professor Loughlin it will be speaking later this term.

198
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:37,199
He wrote a book, a very short guide, a very useful book: this short guide to the British

199
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,790
constitution published very recently in which he said it might be the case that

200
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,420
"the British way of muddling through is best suited to the challenges ahead".

201
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,449
It's the classic argument for muddling through the British constitution.

202
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,140
Lots of people in the British governmental system like it.

203
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:56,100
"This, though, will never satisfy constitutional modernizers",

204
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,310
of whom were also a large number.

205
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:02,680
"If Britain is a democracy in which power is exercised in the name of the people,

206
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,430
can the crown still offer an adequate symbol of state?

207
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,660
This is precisely the question which is now to be tested in a referendum" - this

208
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:14,290
was written before the referendum - "on independence for Scotland

209
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,180
scheduled for autumn 2014.

210
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:22,239
The Treaty of Lisbon of 2009, it might be noted, requires the EU

211
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,260
to respect the 'constitutional identity' of its member states. But do the British

212
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:31,450
still possess the confidence to specify that identity?" It's a good question and

213
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:37,120
it was backed, I think, by the Scottish referendum. I think it did back that question.

214
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,500
We'll hear more about that in the weeks and months ahead, I am sure.

215
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,699
So I think this backs the challenge - we don't have to answer this today,

216
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,930
I just thought some...good sort of think about this: "Should Britain move to

217
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:54,670
a written constitution, make its remaining unelected State offices

218
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:58,270
fully democratic" - if you think about that, that's quite radical in the context of

219
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,430
what was up there just now -

220
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:05,829
"and, more importantly, creating a 'constitutional identity' for the country?"

221
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:10,358
And "has the Scottish referendum and the outcome of that made this more urgent?"

222
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:16,990
So just pause on that thought. Talk more about this with Martin Loughlin and others

223
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:24,520
in the weeks ahead. Feel free if you want to chip in, the same thing about this at any point.

224
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:32,500
Now, moving on to Parliament and the Executive. "As government has become

225
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,350
bigger and more complex"...

226
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:39,730
Sorry, a bigger and more complex activity - with my note - "and prime ministers have

227
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:44,200
become more 'presidential', Parliament has, arguably, become less important".

228
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,260
We'll hear from Professor George Jones about this. He's written

229
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:51,820
a book about prime ministers and, I think, that's his view very broadly,

230
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:57,340
but for him to say that. And certainly for any of you who've watched or will now watch

231
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:01,389
British politics, you'll see that the media concentrate relentlessly on David Cameron,

232
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:05,440
the Prime Minister, Ed Miliband, the Leader of the Opposition, Nick Clegg,

233
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,250
the Leader of the Liberal Democrats, much in view this week at the Lib Dem's Conference

234
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:15,970
in Glasgow, and, of course, on Alex Salmond, the Scottish First Minister,

235
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:23,230
and ever more Sir Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, our Mayor of London here,

236
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,520
in the fair capital.

237
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:30,160
And these people do get an extraordinary amount of coverage and publicity

238
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,860
compared with many other parliamentarians in need other parts of

239
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,330
the political system.

240
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:42,700
Britain has a very nationalized...national media which reinforces this.

241
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,810
Members of Parliament, of the whom there are six hundred and fifty - a large number

242
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:51,250
by international standards - have to spend more and more time with their

243
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:55,600
constituents' problems. This is an element of something I'm going to talk about in a moment.

244
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,659
Britain is a centralized country, that's more power has been

245
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,490
drawn to the center.

246
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:05,770
It's often the case that constituents - that's any of us, who live in the

247
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:10,900
constituency and we all do within the UK - have to go more often and nod to their

248
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,379
members of Parliament.

249
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,670
If, for example, they've got a problem...if you had a problem with a visa or with your housing,

250
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:19,630
then go to the MPs. And that means members of parliament now have

251
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:26,590
huge amounts of constituency work to do, they hold surgeries. And this means that

252
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:30,850
as they get more power, local government has declined,

253
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,439
I'll say a bit more about that in a moment.

254
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,950
Leaving members of Parliament looking more and more locally at their constituents

255
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:39,550
while these cabinet ministers, Prime Minister leave the Opposition,

256
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:44,800
Prime Minister's Question Time are what most people see as politics.

257
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,100
That, I think, backs the interesting question of whether this has something to do

258
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:54,310
with the often discussed disconnect between most people's lives and politics.

259
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:59,770
Politics, as seen only on the television, is clearly disconnected.

260
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:04,450
It's more like a film in some ways than a real thing.

261
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:07,900
If you know...if you were living in Switzerland with cantons and very local politics,

262
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:13,779
you might well see things differently. However, and it is quite a significant however,

263
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:19,359
more recently Select Committees, which are subgroups of the House of Commons,

264
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:25,590
Committees which have a membership...which reflects the membership of the House of

265
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:31,599
Commons by party and have committee chairs who also reflect the balance of

266
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,830
the whole House of Commons - so you get a number of Labor chairs even though

267
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,168
the Labour Party's in opposition.

268
00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:42,460
They have undoubtedly been able to provide Parliament with teeth.

269
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:47,649
If you look on the excellent no-hard-to-find Parliament website, just a wonderful

270
00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:52,330
archive of Select Committee's hearings, you will see a number of Select Committees

271
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:57,699
digging their teeth into public officials who, they think, have not done the right thing,

272
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,960
broadcasters who they...you might say it's a bit sort of

273
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:07,989
overtheatrical sometimes, but it undoubtedly has been...has seen a rise of the Select Committee

274
00:21:07,989 --> 00:21:13,809
and, with it, their chairs as public figures.

275
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:19,779
And many Select Committee chairs these days are more visible in public life than junior ministers.

276
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:26,589
And that is a big change. Here's an example. That's what most people would

277
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:28,989
think of as politics - Prime Minister's Question Time,

278
00:21:28,989 --> 00:21:34,299
soundbite on the nine o'clock news. Here we've got David Cameron, looks as if

279
00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:37,839
he's having fun at the Labour Party's expenses - he often does.

280
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:41,139
There they all sit looking rather glum over there:

281
00:21:41,139 --> 00:21:47,559
Sadiq Khan, Alan Johnson, Ed Miliband and Harriet Harman.

282
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:51,460
This is a very typical tableau and you can see it the other way around

283
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,809
some of the time, obviously. But here, now,

284
00:21:55,809 --> 00:21:59,139
even if know who this one...this is Mrs. Hodge. Anybody know Mrs. Hodge?

285
00:21:59,139 --> 00:22:01,599
She's the chair...Mrs. Hodge...Yes, you?

286
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:06,759
MP for Barking, very good, well done. Now...quite a lot of people

287
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:10,290
know Mrs. Hodge. And Mrs. Hodges is chair of the Public Accounts Committee.

288
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:14,439
She's a Labour MP. This is the most powerful Select Committee in the House of Commons.

289
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:19,629
It is backed up by the National Audit Office which is

290
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:24,800
a proper Department, which is then parliamentary institution, not a

291
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:30,200
government institution. And Mrs. Hodge has really made a real name for herself

292
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,850
in holding public servants, particularly those who spend large amounts of public money,

293
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:39,530
to account. And again, National Audit Office reports and

294
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:43,820
Public Accounts Committee reports are a wonderful source, along with the House of Commons

295
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:48,139
library notes, if you really want something that's a good source for essays.

296
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:54,320
And they're a great source of information about contemporary politics.

297
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,460
and I think Mrs. Hodge, but other Select Committee chairs as well

298
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,600
have done exactly the same thing and retiree, who chairs the Treasury Select Committee,

299
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:08,300
is a conservative, John Whittingdale at the Media Select Committee, Keith Vaz - the

300
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:12,379
Home Affairs Committee. You'll see all of them now holding the Government

301
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,390
to account in a way that wasn't true

302
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:17,870
anything like is true in the past, and that's partly because Select Committee chairs

303
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:22,669
and members are now elected by MPs themselves. They're not simply

304
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,950
appointed by their own parties' authorities and whips.

305
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:32,150
Now, the influence of Select Committee, this is just a

306
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:38,300
quote from a book, sort of book, by Meg Russell and another...

307
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:43,610
published in 2011 which says: "Recent years have been characterised by scepticism -

308
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:46,729
sometimes verging on cynicism - about the effectiveness of the British House of Commons.

309
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:50,630
Particularly during the time of large government majorities following

310
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:56,600
the 1997 and 2001 elections, MPs came to be characterised as 'poodles'",

311
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:01,459
there's a viewer long memories, you remember, MPs...Labour MPs, at the time it was

312
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,450
popularly imagined...Had pages that told them what to do,

313
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:08,660
and there was a lot of stuff in the media about this at the time.

314
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:12,380
"Doubt was expressed about the extent to which the Commons could have a genuine impact on

315
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:16,550
government policy. And this was reinforced by the fact that during Tony Blair's premiership

316
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:19,850
the Government was defeated only four times in the House of Commons.

317
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:24,200
However  - point I was making a moment ago - Select Committees are taken

318
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,860
increasingly seriously by government, and have become an established and respected

319
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,510
part of the system".

320
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,100
So, in the unwritten British constitutional arrangements,

321
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:36,260
here we have a check and a balance really,

322
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:43,220
the evolution of a new check and balance on the relatively powerful Executive.

323
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:49,160
And we'll hear more about this in a couple of lectures next term, including from

324
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:55,130
Mrs. Hodge's Deputy - he's a conservative who will be giving a lecture next term.

325
00:24:55,670 --> 00:25:00,950
Now, the challenge here, it seems to me, is "should Parliament be given greater

326
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:05,900
powers to act as a 'check' on the Executive, for example, by increased

327
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,600
support for the Opposition?" The Opposition...and when you are in

328
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:13,100
government you've got whole of the Civil Service working for you. In Opposition

329
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:17,629
you've got a little bit of money which is made available from public

330
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:21,830
purse to support a tiny research team, but that's about it

331
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:28,159
and anything you can raise privately. So the Government has much more capacity.

332
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,760
So more support, perhaps, for the Opposition, more for Committees -

333
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,750
though Mrs. Hodge's Committee, the PAC, has the National Audit Office behind it,

334
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:39,530
other Select Committees have one or two advisors and some Clark, who are very good,

335
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:43,190
but it's not exactly like congressional committees in the United States

336
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:47,150
which have big teams supporting their members in a way that would be

337
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:53,690
unthinkable in the historically slightly more relaxed House of Commons.

338
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:56,420
Should individual MPs have more support?

339
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:02,180
They now have enormous local post bags and constituency work, and the more

340
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:06,170
they have of that, less support they got - less support...in relation to

341
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:10,940
what they need - the less time they have to spend doing that other job,

342
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:16,400
because their job is to be a representative in Parliament, but they are there,

343
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,270
in Parliament, just as much to be in Parliament as to be back in the constituency.

344
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:24,830
They tend to spend about half the week in each.

345
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:28,520
So, you know, should there be greater powers to act as a check on the Executive

346
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,900
in this rather centralized constitution-free system?

347
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:41,510
The Civil Service. You'll be hearing from Professor Kate Jenkins, who's sitting here,

348
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:44,150
about the Civil Service in a few weeks time.

349
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:49,970
"Britain has developed a large, politically independent civil service"...

350
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:53,450
this is one of the first places in the world to do this, to move away from cronyism and

351
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:59,450
appointing people's friends to having entry exams and appointment by merit

352
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:04,400
to run the business of government. In this system - I think it's fair to say

353
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,780
until very recently, in the still a struggle about this - "'Generalised' competence has been prized

354
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:14,149
over professional skills". So, accountants and economist, for example,

355
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:17,360
not very highly treasured in government traditionally,

356
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:22,100
were as those with a rounded understanding of the world, with general skills,

357
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:28,400
who can move one department to another much more prized.

358
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,510
Though, in fairness to the Civil Service,

359
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:33,740
it has been struggling in recent years with how to balance getting more of these experts in

360
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:37,820
without losing the generalized skills and in fairness there is a need, I think, for a balance.

361
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:43,550
"Cabinet ministers have increasingly appointed 'SPADs' - 'special advisors'.

362
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:48,169
Many of you may have met special advisors. They are an interesting breed

363
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:56,390
that allows ministers to bring people into the Department

364
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:59,000
and then have them in their outer office,

365
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,250
you know, as a sort of direct political contact, working with the civil servants

366
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:08,210
who are still non-political, of course, delivering the government's objectives,

367
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:12,140
but in a non-political way, but with these special advisors in the outer office.

368
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:16,400
Now, sometimes these relationships work really-really well,

369
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:21,500
and sometimes they work really-really badly, depending on how sensitive the special advisors are

370
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:26,840
and how much the minute civil servants feel their world is being intruded on

371
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:31,459
by these special advisors.

372
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:35,240
"Some ministers would like to move towards having senior officials who are appointed by the Government of the day".

373
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,360
And, indeed, it's fascinating. There was a story in The Financial Times

374
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,219
this morning,

375
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:45,450
pointing out how Michael Gove, who used to be the Education Secretary

376
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:50,190
and now has a new role in the Government as the Leader of the House...

377
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:55,710
Chief Whip, sorry. I've got him confusing with William Hague. Chief Whip, thank you.

378
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,429
Chief Whip.

379
00:28:56,429 --> 00:29:00,929
He has started to attend the weekly meetings of the Permanent Secretaries.

380
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:04,740
Now, this is a very big and unusual step,

381
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,909
not much liked by the civil servants. Thank you for the Chief...He's indeed the Chief Whip.

382
00:29:08,909 --> 00:29:13,380
And that seems somebody who is the Government's business manager.

383
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:19,800
Attending the meetings of civil servants is a big and unusual change to have occurred.

384
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:25,620
Now, "the civil service can be seen as lacking in management, financial and other expertise",

385
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:30,360
but in fairness to it,

386
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:37,289
its skills as a permanent government, or permanent deliverer of government,

387
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:42,960
and its lack of political bias are clearly enormously important to the operation

388
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,360
of the state, and there are trade-offs here.

389
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:53,428
This is the head of the... it's the Cabinet's Office...Cabinet Secretary

390
00:29:53,429 --> 00:29:57,480
Sir Jeremy Heywood, stepping out of a car - lots of pictures of him on the Internet

391
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,250
stepping out of the car for some reason -

392
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:04,409
going into Downing Street, it would appear. And this, of course, here, is

393
00:30:04,409 --> 00:30:07,860
the fictitious account of life inside government, if any of you have ever seen

394
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,879
"The thick of it".

395
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,940
I thought of playing a clip, but I couldn't find one

396
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,000
that I could respectably play.

397
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,810
So I didn't, but you can find them. There was a particularly good one,

398
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:22,520
when I was looking for this photograph, of 'life imitating art' on the BBC website.

399
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:27,290
It's a BBC clip on YouTube, available through YouTube, which shows

400
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:30,980
how things that happened in "The thick of it" then happened in real life soon after.

401
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,980
So...and, of course, "The Thick of it", although having Doctor Who

402
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:41,900
in the front of the picture as well to make it seem
more odd-looking,

403
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,320
"The Thick of it", although, of course, a satirical take on government.

404
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,830
I think you'd find very few people in government who didn't think it had a vestige,

405
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:54,530
a tiny element of certain elements of the way both the previous Labour Government

406
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:58,940
and then the current Conservative Lib Dem coalition operate.

407
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:03,590
Perhaps, in different ways. This was a bit more 'shouty', and the early days of

408
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:07,669
"The Thick of it" under the coalition were a bit more 'new age', but there was a definite...

409
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,570
I'm not saying you should watch it to learn British government and politics,

410
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:18,200
but I'm not saying you shouldn't watch either. Now, just to take on this issue

411
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,100
from the Institute for Public Policy Research who published a long report on

412
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:26,660
this last year, made recommendations for reform. And I'm not saying he's aright,

413
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:33,830
there're just examples of what a commentator, an external commentator, might say.

414
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,649
You know that we should "give the prime minister the power to appoint permanent secretaries,

415
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:40,790
but without politicising the civil service". You can see in that comment

416
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:46,190
there is a paradox, really. Having...your obviously permanent secretaries

417
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:50,900
whom the Government of the day wants to work with, but if they're appointed by the Government,

418
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,350
there is a risk of politicization. "Providing secretaries of state and ministers

419
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:57,620
who run their own departments with an extended office of

420
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:02,360
ministerial staff that they personally appoint" - we're in the same territory here -

421
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,409
"and who work directly on their behalf in the department". And what you can see here

422
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:11,990
is the tension between the traditional British way of doing things

423
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:17,210
and a sort of cabin air, an american-style government, of a kind that

424
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:20,100
looks fine works right therem, but it's very different from

425
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:24,149
the traditions that Britain has operated with the independent Civil Service,

426
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:27,150
the Executive taken out of the Legislature.

427
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,189
They propose "strengthening the role of the head of the civil service to hold

428
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:36,929
permanent secretaries to account". The current head of the civil service,

429
00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:41,700
who is not Sir Jeremy Heywood, as recently as just about to step down,

430
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,330
gave a very interesting speech at the Institute for Government,

431
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:49,139
which is available on their website, about his efforts to help

432
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,690
to hold secretaries to account, if you want to follow that up.

433
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:56,520
The IPPR suggested "introducing fixed-term, four-year contracts

434
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,490
for new permanent secretaries" -

435
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,750
these are the people at the top of each department, I should've added.

436
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,900
"Strengthening the external accountability of civil servants in key operational roles" -

437
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,418
that's what Mrs. Hodge has been doing. And then, of course, "enabling the civil service

438
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:13,679
to better support opposition parties - again controversial - by allowing officials

439
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,419
to be seconded into opposition parties to help them with policy development".

440
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:22,980
So all of these ideas are perfectly sensible, but once you say them

441
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,630
they do tend to,

442
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:28,919
I think, infringe the way many traditional civil servants and, indeed, non-traditional,

443
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:33,900
but extensible servants would imagine their world working,

444
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:38,610
but they may be things that would improve the operation of government

445
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:39,840
and, indeed, the civil service.

446
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,820
So the challenge here, it seems to me, is: "Has the time come to move to

447
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:52,168
a politically-appointed civil service of people with professional expertise?"

448
00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:55,500
It'd be a very different kind of civil service. Possibly better, possibly not.

449
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:59,390
Something we can talk about in the weeks ahead.

450
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:06,929
The Welfare State. We all know about Britain's Welfare State,

451
00:34:06,929 --> 00:34:11,219
many European step countries and, indeed, others have either an extent

452
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:12,118
or developing Welfare State.

453
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:16,739
"Britain has developed a very large set of welfare services, - which we call 'Welfare State' -,

454
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:22,168
in the years since 1945". The development of a National Health Service,

455
00:34:22,168 --> 00:34:28,500
education for all, social housing,

456
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:33,690
a range of services where there's a social element in the provision.

457
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:37,379
This 'Welfare State' now appears to face a number of challenges,

458
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:42,899
not the least of which is: "Will the public pay the taxes sufficient to fund

459
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:44,668
a full welfare state?"

460
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:48,870
Any of you watching the party conferences recently, you will see this debate

461
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:54,299
subliminally there all the time. Famously, Leader of the Opposition,

462
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,470
you remember this, neglected to talk about the deficit,

463
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:02,459
Britain's large deficit, but the Conservatives have been criticized subsequently

464
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:07,200
for promising tax cuts the time when Britain is indeed still running

465
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,180
a very large deficit.

466
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:13,919
The difficulty for all parties is that they've got themselves into a sort of fixed system,

467
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,630
like a weather system where the taxes...

468
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:23,280
it appears, they are willing to charge more to make people pay...are less than

469
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,150
the scale of the state that people want. And I'll show you a chart about this in a moment.

470
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:33,600
Beyond that we are a consumer society, it's a cliche, but you know what we mean,

471
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,320
we want to consume things, people understand their rights and those rights are

472
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,510
a long way away from the ideas that underlay, for example, the National Health Service

473
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,430
back in the forties.

474
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:48,419
I don't think when the NHS was created an iron better from a great

475
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:53,460
Labour politician created it, that he or anybody else thought that people would

476
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:59,700
feel they had the right to demand every new drug that came on the market

477
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:04,529
or very expensive new drugs. Now, all of us in the room can sympathize with people who feel that

478
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:09,600
if they are a relative is ill that they should be able to get a new drug

479
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:15,600
from a system that's free at the point of use, but, clearly, there isn't

480
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:21,779
limitless money and consumer attitudes to what we consume may have made

481
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,750
running the Welfare State more difficult than it once was.

482
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:31,590
Some households, it has been argued, have become 'dependent' on the state.

483
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:37,290
If you look at the scale of what the Beveridge report, the great 1942 report,

484
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:39,820
that proposed the creation of Welfare State,

485
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:45,280
the minimal level of unemployment pay and other benefits that it proposed, compared with

486
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,320
the scale of welfare today, as of today, the welfare budget, pensions and

487
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,890
all others cost more than 200 billion pounds in the United Kingdom.

488
00:36:54,700 --> 00:37:02,950
That is a very significant sum of money for a 1.5 trillion, so 1600 billion, economy.

489
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:09,640
So it's 200 out of 1600. And there are those who believe that

490
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:15,670
households in some cases have become 'dependent' on the state. And, of course,

491
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:18,610
over-all the state...the whole of the Welfare State has grown substantially,

492
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:23,740
not only social security, but the National Health Service, schools, housing

493
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,509
and more besides.

494
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:33,130
Now, this is a classic 1940s style cartoon

495
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:41,230
showing Beveridge attempting to slay the five great evils that he saw lying...

496
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:46,960
It's interesting how creative British public servants were

497
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,340
during the Second World War, coming up with a series of reports and proposals for legislation

498
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:56,380
to change the way the country ran, partly because of the cooperation

499
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:01,870
and nationalization that have gone on during that very Second World War.

500
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:07,330
So: Want, Ignorance, Disease, Squalor, Idleness - these great evils

501
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:09,730
that were to be slayed by the Welfare State.

502
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:15,520
More recently the current Secretary of State, Iain Duncan Smith, you'll see him in the news,

503
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,840
is trying to introduce a radical new reform to bring many of the welfare benefits,

504
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:24,430
other than pensions, together into a universal credit and in attempt,

505
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:28,779
in his view, to reduce dependency - and it's not as if the Labour Party

506
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:34,150
hasn't brought me support at these, so, you know, reduce dependency, but also

507
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:38,350
to remove perverse incentives, kind of incentives that have existed where

508
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:42,490
people who receive benefits find that as they earn money and come off benefits

509
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:45,900
they become worse off.

510
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:50,410
So, in fairness to Iain Duncan Smith the objective is clearly one that

511
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,460
many people might support,

512
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:57,260
but crucially is very difficult to introduce because of the computer systems and

513
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:01,730
moving from one system to another and the changes in treatment of

514
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:08,839
individuals as that happens. In a book written by another LSE professor,

515
00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:12,529
not certainly one who's speaking in this course, but one of his books will be

516
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:17,480
on the reading list, called "Understanding the Finance of Welfare" Howard Glennerster

517
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:22,460
has written. This is a very interesting up some, it seems to me, of the problem

518
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:27,680
that the free at the point of delivery Welfare State offers any society.

519
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,830
"Users of public services seem increasingly dissatisfied,

520
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:35,240
despite the fact that the quality of services has improved since 1950.

521
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:40,520
The level of consumer expectations seems to be rising faster. Discontent may be

522
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:44,390
put down to a malevolent press or professions who continuously talk of

523
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:49,980
'crisis' as a way of gaining more resources from the Chancellor.

524
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,540
The NHS, of course, has been in 'crisis'

525
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,270
ever since it was created", - and, indeed, it's certainly in the square bracket,

526
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:54,680
certainly as today,

527
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,580
according to the media this morning. "However, there is a more structural explanation

528
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:06,440
for this continuing dilemma. Claus Offe, a German Marxist sociologist,

529
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,220
comes closest to capturing it, although there is

530
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:15,439
an equivalent New Right explanation. In a pure market economy the price mechanism

531
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:21,470
manages individuals' expectations. They may desire a Mercedes or

532
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:25,730
a holiday in the Bahamas but they know their capacity to afford such luxuries

533
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:30,680
is determined by their own worth in the labor market. They do not blame the government.

534
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:35,899
In health and education, where no prices is charged,

535
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:41,000
expectations are not managed downwards by the market. Supply and demand have to be managed

536
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,580
by the political process. [We need to consider] the way in which scarce resources

537
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:52,400
are managed and allocated in a non-market system. The dilemmas should not

538
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,550
blind us to the fact that all scarce resources have to be rationed".

539
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:01,210
And if you look at an institution that many of you who live in Britain

540
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:01,990
will know - NICE,

541
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:07,290
which is the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, I think it's changed

542
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,579
its name, but near enough NICE,

543
00:41:09,579 --> 00:41:14,710
they have had the problem for some years now trying to ration the use of drugs,

544
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:20,740
prescribed drugs in the NHS. And once you start talking about rationing,

545
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:25,779
many politicians run away, don't like to talk about rationing.

546
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,650
But if you think about it,

547
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:30,849
the NHS has to ration health resources. There isn't a limitless

548
00:41:30,849 --> 00:41:34,630
supply of doctors, nurses and pharmaceuticals.

549
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:41,619
It is all about rationing, and politics is how that has to be done.

550
00:41:41,619 --> 00:41:45,100
Here's the chart I promised. This is my favorite chart at the moment. This is produced by

551
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:50,440
the Office for Budget Responsibility, an excellent organization with an excellent website,

552
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:56,260
which produces independent economic forecasts and measures of

553
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:00,640
public expenditures. Just wonderful. And the top line there shows public expenditure

554
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,920
as a proportion of GDP in the United Kingdom since 1978-1979,

555
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,670
it's the dark line you can see it at the top there.

556
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:15,339
the lighter line which is generally
below it is government revenues that tax

557
00:42:15,339 --> 00:42:19,660
take and every time the dark line is
above the light line

558
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:23,980
there's a deficit in the very very
occasional times when the light line is

559
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:26,170
above the dark line there's a surplus

560
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:30,819
so at all times the one who bit the dark
lines above the light line the

561
00:42:30,819 --> 00:42:34,600
government national the national debt is
rising and of course has been rising

562
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:39,400
substantially the dotted line marks
broadly where we are today just was

563
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,990
slightly this way now

564
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:47,319
and as you can see and what we face is a
substantial further fall in public

565
00:42:47,319 --> 00:42:52,509
expenditure as a proportion of GDP up to
the point the deficit is eradicated

566
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,630
but more interesting that is the if you
look at the smooth average of the lower

567
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:02,440
line the government receipts line from
1992 today

568
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:06,980
it's never got above thirty eight
percent of gdp

569
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:07,550
so no government in

570
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:13,910
united kingdom has put taxes up about
thirty-eight percent of GDP ever in any

571
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:17,450
year since 1990

572
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:22,250
that's nearly quarter of a century if
you listen to the narrative of politics

573
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:25,670
no desire to put taxes up on most people

574
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:29,120
site designed to put them up on the rich
but not on everybody else

575
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:34,250
the rich sadly are not large enough in
number to change that line much there

576
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:38,300
for Britain has stalled attractive so
we're not unique in this but Britain is

577
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:44,600
now trapped in the position of wanting
to have in effect but it simply Sweden

578
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:49,520
or Frances public sector with America's
taxes and that's what this chart shows

579
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,610
we want a big estate and what then

580
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:59,120
some politicians are able to convince us
to pay and that is a real problem

581
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:04,690
because within the expenditure line
health and welfare is growing so

582
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,430
everything else is having to shrink
defense shrunk local government

583
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:12,410
shrinking police and fire shrinking big
issues will come back to those i'll be

584
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:14,299
talking about that in a few weeks time

585
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:19,220
so how could the government changed the
welfare state and Institute ensure it

586
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:24,490
was sustainable just to ration resources
but also that this did not generate

587
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:29,630
unintended consequences and I think the
only answer to that is to put up taxes

588
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:33,800
are not advocating putting up taxes i'm
just saying that unless we are to have

589
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,500
much more rationing in the welfare state

590
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:40,400
we are going to need to put taxes up and
it taxes don't go up as a share of the

591
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,180
economy

592
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:45,140
then we will see substantially more
rationing the story in The Independent

593
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:50,600
today the independent newspaper saying
that it may be that the one on one of

594
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:54,110
the professional organizations saying it
may be necessary to charge people

595
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:55,550
hospital fees

596
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:59,840
sorry hotel fees for staying in
hospitals and that will get more debates

597
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:03,320
of that kind in the coming months and
years

598
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:08,570
europe this is not quite as random as on

599
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:11,510
I mean this is with them sort of moving
through the weeks of lectures quickly

600
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,170
here in summary

601
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:19,530
europe now Europe's been an
extraordinarily potent issue dominating

602
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:24,000
British government and politics for 30
or 40 years now

603
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:29,690
Britain joined the UN the seventies had
a referendum in 1975 about whether we

604
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:30,540
should stay in or not

605
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:35,250
and of course many of you will be aware
that a number of British politicians and

606
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:41,609
indeed an entire new insurgent political
party a lobbying hard for Britain

607
00:45:41,609 --> 00:45:47,400
radically to change its relationship
with Europe broadly defined

608
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:53,250
now what we're going to look at within
this course is both your as an issue of

609
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:58,470
Rights and the cute part of the
judiciary and the court system but also

610
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:05,549
Europe as the European Union remembering
of course and this is rarely . really

611
00:46:05,549 --> 00:46:10,799
made in public discourse that of course
the human rights issue and the European

612
00:46:10,799 --> 00:46:14,250
Court of Human Rights is nothing to do
with the EU there listening to the

613
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:19,589
debate on these things be hard to
differentiate them most of the time now

614
00:46:19,589 --> 00:46:26,279
. professor conjugate he will talk about
the judiciary and rights and the British

615
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,970
approach to rights but in summary the
way

616
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,430
Britain has a . Britain has done is to
adopt as a number of countries have the

617
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:40,379
many of the elements of the European
Convention on Human Rights they've been

618
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:45,960
incorporated by convention into our and
other countries legal systems either

619
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:50,400
through constitutional provision or by
statute we don't have a constitution

620
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:56,990
after all or through judicial processes
and then the European Court of Human

621
00:46:56,990 --> 00:47:02,609
Rights which is not as I stress part of
the European Union it his cases that are

622
00:47:02,609 --> 00:47:04,710
alleged to contravene the country

623
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:09,590
the convention the court cases cases are
heard in the UK course in other

624
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:13,790
countries cause we can in the end be
appealed to the european court of human

625
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:15,890
rights now

626
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:20,250
again those of you who watched the news
carefully will know there's a number of

627
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:23,800
high-profile cases often though not
exclusive

628
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,800
only involving terrorism suspects

629
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:32,799
not only that and occasionally people
have broken the law have ended up in the

630
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,840
european court of human rights and cause
not in significant aggravation to some

631
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:42,700
British politicians as a result of that
the conservatives that their party

632
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:47,200
conference recently proposed to repeal
the Human Rights Act 1998 which was the

633
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:52,600
law that by which the Labour government
of the time incorporated provisions of

634
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,240
the European Convention into British law

635
00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:01,509
so that's how this was done and instead
to produce a bill of rights

636
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:05,350
this would be in effect to create
something that sounded a bit more

637
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:11,410
English a bill of rights and 16 18 and
going back to history and trying to

638
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:17,589
escape in part from the european
convention on human rights but

639
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:20,890
particularly actually not that but from
the court

640
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:27,400
I just thought a cartoon on this
occasion and I like this color I mean

641
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:33,280
this is see it is such a relief to dicks
the human rights court and get back to

642
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:38,680
common sense is what the caption is on
this particular cartoon from The Daily

643
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:45,339
Telegraph last week and clearly that is
the sense that if we you know that among

644
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:48,400
many politicians are not only in the
conservative party if only we could

645
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,200
control our own

646
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,410
the decisions of not this controller
decisions of the courts would have all

647
00:48:54,410 --> 00:49:00,170
these case with cases were decided by
British judges you get common sense i

648
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:06,829
think that's the sort of prevailing
feeling now would repealing the Human

649
00:49:06,829 --> 00:49:11,329
Rights Act 1998 really make a difference
unless the UK withdrew from the

650
00:49:11,329 --> 00:49:17,240
convention system under which the
European confirm convention operates ,

651
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:22,640
Garrity will be speaking to you later on
in the course I think argues not in ddr

652
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:29,990
give not in the Guardian a few days ago
and and you might want to argue analyzed

653
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:30,680
you know I think so

654
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,859
it's a moot point we don't have a
different view on this as to whether

655
00:49:33,859 --> 00:49:42,200
it's a good or a bad thing that there is
a European long stop influencing British

656
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:49,460
law acting as a sort of and an
internationally based appeal court for

657
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:53,780
perceived or real in justices with in
this country

658
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:57,619
now people have different views on that
and we'll hear from the about that from

659
00:49:57,619 --> 00:50:05,750
congregating in his lecture local
government local government and

660
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:10,369
centralization as I said much earlier on
britain's a unitary and not a federal

661
00:50:10,369 --> 00:50:15,589
state with no written constitution this
makes it very easy for national

662
00:50:15,589 --> 00:50:21,259
governments of any party to pass laws
that affect the powers of sub national

663
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:22,990
government

664
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:27,140
now interestingly that has led to the
creation of devolved scottish and welsh

665
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:30,259
and Northern Irish assemblies

666
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:34,310
but within England and indeed separately
in each of those countries local

667
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:39,890
government has actually become less
powerful written is a highly centralized

668
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:45,490
country particularly and then if you
look at the share of taxes and political

669
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:50,300
control that are held at Westminster for
England separately in Edinburgh

670
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,780
cardiff and north Belfast for the other
three parts of the UK

671
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:58,700
ninety-five percent of all the taxes in
the United Kingdom are set by the

672
00:50:58,700 --> 00:50:59,450
Chancellor

673
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:05,330
exchequer if you look at the OECD
statistics beautifully laid out in

674
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:07,490
fabulous charts

675
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:10,669
so you can see how Britain compares with
other UK compares with other countries

676
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:14,660
in oecd you'll find that this is a very
low percentage

677
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:20,660
indeed and indeed as the other the five
percent which is a local property tax is

678
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,310
frozen and cat

679
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:26,870
it's really a hundred percent so here we
are in a large mature democracy with a

680
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:31,190
hundred percent of all the taxes that by
national government very very unusual as

681
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:36,950
oecd helpfully shows England's had known
to meet devolution even though England

682
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:39,259
the country of 52 million people

683
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:42,770
scotland five Wales three northern
ireland one and a half million people

684
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:47,900
know d evolution within England Labour
government did try a referendum in the

685
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:52,700
Northeast to introduce devolved regional
government there in 2004

686
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:57,379
but the powers on offer was so modest
that the North people of the north east

687
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:02,480
they might be with good reason rejected
it so what we have seen laterally is new

688
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:07,340
forms of local governance emerging
efforts to sort of get around this city

689
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:13,490
regional level in other sub - Allah
units that are not quite new government

690
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:22,100
units but do provide an opportunity for
some more effective operation as an

691
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:29,509
area-wide of the one local authority
practice and Wilson writing about local

692
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:32,960
democracy and local government say
there's a vital element of the

693
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,710
constitutional makes the local element
has withered and his danger of

694
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:40,100
disappearing altogether even more
pessimistic and I was just then the

695
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:42,410
centralization many services

696
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:47,890
the circumvention of local government
and the diminution of local politics of

697
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:51,380
all compounded to foster a democracy
that increasingly north and belittles

698
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:56,840
all things local which gives excessive
emphasis and national politics going

699
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,890
back to the pictures and some of the
points I made earlier the persistently

700
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:05,150
low turnout at local elections and the
tendency for them to be used as

701
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:09,809
indicators of National Party preferences
are symptomatic of this trend

702
00:53:09,809 --> 00:53:14,400
the practice and habits of democracy at
the local level which remains the

703
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,709
foundation of our national democratic
culture are in retreat and in fact this

704
00:53:19,709 --> 00:53:24,808
is quoted in the prep by practicing
Muslim but it's the forward by Sir Simon

705
00:53:24,809 --> 00:53:31,499
Jenkins great columnist in the Guardian
in his forward to that a book

706
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:34,828
I think that's pretty fair comment but
we can talk about that in the weeks

707
00:53:34,829 --> 00:53:39,239
ahead here the challenges does the
centralization of power in England

708
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:45,509
weekend local government in ways which
in turn undermine local politics and

709
00:53:45,509 --> 00:53:48,900
thus the basis for the national
political parties and that's a very if

710
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,699
you think about it an interesting
question

711
00:53:50,699 --> 00:53:55,499
all politics is local not my original
idea an American politician said that

712
00:53:55,499 --> 00:54:03,749
all politics is local and the truth is
if local government erodes and inroads

713
00:54:03,749 --> 00:54:07,589
we're with the basis of national
politics be all members of parliament

714
00:54:07,589 --> 00:54:12,479
are selected by local party members
local party members

715
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:16,780
look to local government many of them
are counselors and without that local

716
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:20,900
government functioning healthfully how
would the parties survive they're

717
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:21,449
already shrinking

718
00:54:21,449 --> 00:54:25,190
how would they survive without that
local unit of government so there is a

719
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:33,419
link between local government and
politics and national politics evolution

720
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:36,420
and I've touched on this already

721
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:41,699
stockland whales have been given their
own Parliament and government

722
00:54:42,809 --> 00:54:47,849
this was a radical change and I said it
was a we can discuss we will discuss

723
00:54:47,849 --> 00:54:53,249
further into the course how this
happened is very centralized state the

724
00:54:53,249 --> 00:54:58,859
United Kingdom suddenly after 1997 with
the advent of the Labour government then

725
00:54:58,859 --> 00:55:04,199
dissolving power to Scotland and Wales
number of reasons for this

726
00:55:04,199 --> 00:55:08,400
it had been tried earlier in fact in the
nineteen seventies not and had been

727
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:16,920
rejected just and we well it's so i
should say was rejected in Wales but not

728
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,600
in Scotland but i was going to explain
when we get there

729
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:23,170
I didn't want to get really go all the
way back through nineteen nineteen

730
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:25,330
seventy-nine again

731
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:29,770
so but there was a threshold i think was
the point there was the threshold at the

732
00:55:29,770 --> 00:55:33,280
time and that's that was very nearly an
issue the other week of course there was

733
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:38,110
a threshold above which the Scots would
have had to get to trigger the

734
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:40,810
devolution that was proposed in the late
seventies

735
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:46,960
so virtually all domestic policy is now
handled by edinburgh and Cardiff

736
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,370
edinburgh and carted now have
extraordinary person indeed Belfast

737
00:55:51,370 --> 00:55:55,390
Northern Irish the Northern Irish
assembly Northern Ireland Assembly has

738
00:55:55,390 --> 00:56:00,879
analogous and significant powers which
given the extraordinary history of

739
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:06,340
Northern Ireland just shows you how
radically things have changed their that

740
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:11,500
has been devolution to northern ireland
assembly which is not available within

741
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:15,610
England and that is a real signal that
our northern ireland has moved on

742
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:22,210
major taxation powers are to be handed
over to Scotland following the 2014

743
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:25,420
referendum those of you watching the
referendum within the last few weeks

744
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:31,300
we've seen golden brown our former prime
minister suddenly appearing as a great

745
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:36,580
hero of the No campaign would appear to
offer on behalf of the labor

746
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:41,770
conservative and liberal democrat
parties much greater taxation power for

747
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:48,220
Scotland power to borrow money welfare
freedom freedom to operate well for part

748
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:52,390
of the welfare system much more radical
even then the Scots had already been

749
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:53,440
offered

750
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:59,110
so what the Scots are going to get is
the thing that was originally refused to

751
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:03,580
them in the questions on the ballot
paper sort of devo max option as it was

752
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:06,790
called which will make Scotland in my
view

753
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:12,900
akin to a federal unit within a federal
state but because we're not a federal

754
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:17,590
state as i said earlier but the Scots
will have very significant autonomy

755
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:23,230
including crucially not only budgeting
autonomy but now tax-raising powers as

756
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:23,920
well

757
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,670
started conservative leader came up with
the most radical suggestion

758
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:29,990
intriguingly to develop all income

759
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:35,209
tax to Scotland the whole income tax and
that would make it a very very developed

760
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:38,900
system indeed and we were still with us
we're now in the process of the

761
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:45,680
Westminster system having to decide
exactly what it now offers scotland on

762
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:49,190
the back of this wails of course we'll
ask for something similar Wells is

763
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:54,530
already been promised tax-raising powers
but you can see that on the belt back of

764
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:58,490
whatever Scotland is now given wales
which is in a slightly different

765
00:57:58,490 --> 00:58:03,169
situation because it's a less affluent
country in terms of its tax raising

766
00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:08,810
capacity but the world will similarly be
offered at least some form of the local

767
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:11,330
income tax and other tax raising powers

768
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:18,410
so how do we create this federal default
system of countries as nations within

769
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:23,149
the united kingdom when the UK isn't a
federal state and more than that was

770
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:29,930
about England England is 50 to 60
seconds of in terms of population and

771
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:32,359
GDP of the United Kingdom

772
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:36,590
professor John Curtis the great several
logical expert from strathclyde

773
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:37,670
university

774
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:42,230
I remember speaking at a lecture in
London about five years ago long before

775
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:49,190
all this was going on making the point
that the only way for a country united

776
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:53,540
kingdom which consists of one country
which has 52 million people in it

777
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:56,690
one with 51 with three and one and one
and a half the anyway that can hold

778
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:59,570
together is if it's some level

779
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:05,630
the Scots the Welsh in the Northern
Irish have more power than their numbers

780
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:08,450
suggest to try to balance hours

781
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:13,310
the imbalance that would otherwise occur
with England being so dominant an

782
00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:14,450
interesting idea

783
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:18,589
I credited to him and happy and I
remember that correctly but it's a good

784
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:19,490
idea

785
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:22,850
and so in in recent times Scotland

786
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:27,680
after all has high levels of public
expenditures in England sodas well so

787
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:31,460
there's Northern Ireland they have more
representation in Parliament of Scotland

788
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:35,630
and of course their own government as
wales and northern ireland do

789
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:40,880
perhaps that's an essential condition
for allowing the united kingdom to

790
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,690
continue but that begs the

791
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:46,999
certain of what happens if you did give
and this is being discussed as we speak

792
00:59:46,999 --> 00:59:51,410
England greater autonomy there are
conservative and other MPs who think

793
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:58,160
England should have its own Parliament
with its own ministers with the first

794
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:02,629
minutes in English First Minister
perhaps like the Scottish First Minister

795
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:04,339
we you know then

796
01:00:04,339 --> 01:00:06,650
then the budget of the English
government will be bigger than the

797
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:10,940
remaining UK government and that would
be a bit lopsided win it a bit like as

798
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:15,739
if California were I don't know bigger
than had a bigger budget than the UK US

799
01:00:15,739 --> 01:00:19,640
federal government or something like
that doesn't kind of makes sense if you

800
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:20,930
sort of think it through

801
01:00:20,930 --> 01:00:25,368
so what will come out of all of this I
suspect though this will happen during

802
01:00:25,369 --> 01:00:32,890
the course of our lectures so this will
be in real time is a another British

803
01:00:32,890 --> 01:00:37,609
constitutional fudge of some kind it'll
be a mixture of some British vote

804
01:00:37,609 --> 01:00:42,199
english votes for some English laws or
parts of that but probably not an

805
01:00:42,199 --> 01:00:46,390
english parliament but we'll see these
debates will be going on in real time

806
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:53,150
around us a cheery picture here before
the referendum actually of the Prime

807
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:55,969
Minister meeting the First Minister
about social said the first minister

808
01:00:55,969 --> 01:00:58,670
meets the prime minister would have been
more accurate in which side of the

809
01:00:58,670 --> 01:01:02,930
understanding of the handsome matter of
Scotland behind them

810
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:12,109
this was at the point where they decided
to hold the referendum and these are two

811
01:01:12,109 --> 01:01:15,140
quotes which I won't read out now
because we're running short while we

812
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:20,779
were beginning to run towards 615 but
this is really the SNP's arguments

813
01:01:20,779 --> 01:01:29,209
distilled here for Scott them becoming
an independent nation and the UK

814
01:01:29,209 --> 01:01:36,490
government's arguments for maintaining
the partnership better together within

815
01:01:36,490 --> 01:01:40,519
never elected from professor Jim
gallaher about this

816
01:01:40,519 --> 01:01:44,319
who took part in this campaign I think
he was actually involved in a

817
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:48,340
no personal secret here on the No
campaign but he will give a very

818
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:54,130
independent view of this I'm sure as he
did when he spoke last year so

819
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:58,750
fascinating on it for me and if any of
you for me

820
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:01,330
anybody get voted in this referendum
either way just as a matter of interest

821
01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:04,330
now I'm not Scottish

822
01:02:04,330 --> 01:02:12,279
i was born in wales as it happens but as
a UK voter i found this referendum the

823
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:17,200
most exciting election in my life more
than general elections and then if any

824
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,940
of you shared that view

825
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:22,000
so even if you weren't Scottish or
voting in the scottish referendum

826
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:27,160
it was never the less than a real
electrifying act activity and as the

827
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,819
early mentioned professor Curtis said it
another seminar here a few weeks ago

828
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:39,819
why was the turnout so high we'll simply
because the result massive 85% turn

829
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:45,520
ninety seven percent registered votes an
extraordinary and an extraordinary

830
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:50,230
election and the result mattered and I'm
afraid the implications this is turning

831
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:53,740
out to lower in other elections because
people think they don't matter that the

832
01:02:53,740 --> 01:03:01,290
tragic the other side of that tragic
coin so challenge was it good or bad for

833
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:06,880
Scotland and in what ways that it did
not vote for independence this is

834
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:10,300
something the Scots and the remainder of
the UK

835
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:14,170
I think we'll debate for a long time to
come they may want to have another go at

836
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:14,440
it

837
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:18,490
that's not relaxed possibility out
depends what the UK government now

838
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:20,529
offers them and how that system works

839
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:25,900
thereafter will it be like Quebec where
there was a second reference and we'll

840
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:28,450
whatever comes out of this be good or
bad for England more powerful Scotland

841
01:03:28,450 --> 01:03:30,910
more powerful Wales more powerful
Northern Ireland

842
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:34,839
what will the English get out of this
the English who are this large majority

843
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:41,650
you generally don't desert themselves
but who may be about to some extent by

844
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:43,750
the English do it now

845
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:51,460
written in Europe as i said earlier know
it know a few more vexed over the long

846
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:51,970
term

847
01:03:51,970 --> 01:03:55,240
then Britain's relationship with Europe

848
01:03:55,780 --> 01:04:01,000
it's a complex relationship and often a
different one

849
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:06,970
Britain had an in-out referendum soon
after we joined in nineteen having not

850
01:04:06,970 --> 01:04:12,220
join the European Community originally
then joined late and had a referendum

851
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:23,200
soon after to decide whether or not we
should stay in the EU euro skepticism

852
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:28,509
we had a lot more of this from Simon
Hicks next term drives a number of

853
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:32,800
conservative and you keep politicians as
a significant fringe the Conservative

854
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:38,980
Party the whole of you keep an insurgent
party within the UK mainstream and to be

855
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:43,570
fair some labor ones as any one party
and advertising it i'm just saying is

856
01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:49,390
the matter of fact one party that is now
four square pro-eu pro Europe would

857
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:53,259
broaden it and that's the liberal
democrats they

858
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:56,230
that's a one they've got a number of
things where they are unique and this is

859
01:04:56,230 --> 01:05:01,839
one of them the lib dems are a
pro-european party labor some way back

860
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:05,770
across the spectrum the conservative
some way from them and you get well

861
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:08,290
beyond them on some kind of spectrum

862
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:17,410
that's fair to all concerned it's hard
not to be aware of the fact that the

863
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:23,200
United the British media are often
highly critical of the EU and other

864
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,950
European institutions whether or not
they're part of the EU

865
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:33,279
maybe if you'll be aware of the endless
fabled stories about some you know still

866
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:38,109
need to have on straight bananas and all
of this nonsense that gets in the media

867
01:05:38,109 --> 01:05:45,790
from time to time and all of that sort
of stuff there's a lot of it but public

868
01:05:45,790 --> 01:05:49,600
opinion is regularly split

869
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:53,799
actually it's generally in favor it
pushed generally push decision will

870
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:59,710
generally say that people on balance
would like to stay in the e u-- of

871
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:04,119
course though we now operate in the
world where the Conservative Party in

872
01:06:04,119 --> 01:06:04,650
particular

873
01:06:04,650 --> 01:06:08,990
and you kept by the Conservatives are
committed but if they win the next

874
01:06:08,990 --> 01:06:11,970
general election outright the election
next year they'd hold an in-out

875
01:06:11,970 --> 01:06:18,240
referendum as to whether UK should stay
there will be it on terms that would

876
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:23,729
have been renegotiated by david cameron
by the Conservatives in the meantime you

877
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:25,740
keep just wants an in-out referendum

878
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:28,979
- I think in fairness to them just to
argue to leave

879
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:32,990
Labour's position is more nuanced
Liberal Democrats I think they're

880
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:35,369
discussing whether or not they should
have a referendum or should support the

881
01:06:35,369 --> 01:06:39,779
idea of a referendum because frankly
whether you believe in staying in all

882
01:06:39,779 --> 01:06:44,670
going getting out a referendum could be
seen at least for a while as clearing

883
01:06:44,670 --> 01:06:45,510
the air

884
01:06:45,510 --> 01:06:48,779
so where the are on either side of the
argument you might think that's just

885
01:06:48,779 --> 01:06:51,240
stop the argument for a bit

886
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:57,930
whether it would or not is another
matter but clearly we may well face a

887
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:02,129
referendum within the next two years and
what the scottish referendum tells us

888
01:07:02,130 --> 01:07:03,450
three years

889
01:07:03,450 --> 01:07:08,250
what the scottish referendum tells us is
that there are consequences consequences

890
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:13,950
in terms of the instability or the
perceived instability of the country's

891
01:07:13,950 --> 01:07:18,750
political and financial institutions
whether it's fair or not you could see

892
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:22,799
from the latter days of the scottish
referendum when it was thought that it

893
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:28,200
was possible to scotts would vote yes to
leave the UK that you know he suddenly

894
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:31,770
started hearing about banks thinking of
moving their headquarters and less

895
01:07:31,770 --> 01:07:36,290
investment and all sorts of you know
fires of Hades pouring down if this

896
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:36,869
happened

897
01:07:36,869 --> 01:07:41,339
now whether it would have been like that
will never neck but all i can say is

898
01:07:41,339 --> 01:07:45,900
that on the basis of that experience
when this debate happens about Brittany

899
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:50,549
you it's hard not to believe will get
the same kind of it all go to the dogs

900
01:07:50,549 --> 01:07:54,509
or the work won't go to the dogs kind of
debate so it'll be a really I think the

901
01:07:54,510 --> 01:07:59,130
scottish referendum absolutely important
vital in its own right was also

902
01:07:59,130 --> 01:08:04,829
revealing in what it tells us about how
and a referendum on britain's staying in

903
01:08:04,829 --> 01:08:11,490
or leaving the EU might turn out so many
good pictures when you come to look at

904
01:08:11,490 --> 01:08:12,600
Britain Europe

905
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:19,680
available this is a classic of President
meter on mrs. Thatcher probably looking

906
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:23,370
the other way to talk to somebody going
cropped like this it simply looks like a

907
01:08:23,370 --> 01:08:26,790
metaphor for everything to do with
Britain's relationships with was not

908
01:08:26,790 --> 01:08:30,149
only Europe also France I'm afraid but
there we are

909
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:38,399
and it is just one of them it is an
undying issue in British politics with

910
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:43,500
here to that we have two lectures on
this from Simon Hicks press X next term

911
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:49,200
now this is what David Cameron thinks
the choice is and he is an interesting

912
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,779
position because he's placed himself

913
01:08:51,779 --> 01:08:57,120
I think that somebody who would want to
vote to stay in the EU but is also the

914
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:00,779
person whose party includes many people
want to leave it and who has to

915
01:09:00,779 --> 01:09:05,399
negotiate if there is this in out
referendum and he still Prime Minister

916
01:09:05,399 --> 01:09:09,330
with Europe which I have to say doesn't
show that much sign and wanting to make

917
01:09:09,330 --> 01:09:14,430
life easy for the British well let's see
what he said at Bloomberg 18 months ago

918
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:19,350
a real choice between leaving or being
part of a new settlement in which

919
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:23,700
Britain shapes and respect the rules of
the single market that is protected by

920
01:09:23,689 --> 01:09:29,549
fair safeguards and free of the spurious
regulation bananas which damages that I

921
01:09:29,550 --> 01:09:31,290
added that obviously damages

922
01:09:31,290 --> 01:09:36,240
Europe's competitiveness choice between
leaving or being part of a new

923
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:39,990
settlement in which Britain is at the
forefront of collective action on issues

924
01:09:39,990 --> 01:09:44,580
like foreign policy and trade and where
we where we leave the door firmly open

925
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:49,559
to new members a new settlement subject
to the democratic legitimacy and

926
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:53,729
accountability of national parliaments
where member states combined inflexible

927
01:09:53,729 --> 01:09:58,190
cooperation respecting national
differences not always trying to

928
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:02,430
eliminate them in which we approved that
some powers can in fact be returned to

929
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:06,810
member states the british want to
repatriate powers most other countries

930
01:10:06,810 --> 01:10:09,660
particularly France and Germany want to
do the opposite

931
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:13,500
in other words a settlement which would
be entirely in keeping with the mission

932
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:18,360
for an updated European Union i have
described today more flexible more

933
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:22,500
adaptable more open fit for the
challenges of the modern age and to

934
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:25,620
those who say a new settlement can't be
negotiated

935
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:29,400
i would say listen to the views of other
parties in our European countries

936
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:34,920
arguing for powers to flow back to
European states well I'm not absolutely

937
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:39,960
sure the core countries are some of the
others might be but of course beyond

938
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:40,740
this

939
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:45,420
what's further added since he made this
speech really to the pecan see of this

940
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:50,970
whole debate is the question of
immigration immigration in unprompted

941
01:10:50,970 --> 01:10:53,970
opinion polling in Britain

942
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:59,370
Maury does regular one . unprompted has
done it for years unprompted questions

943
01:10:59,370 --> 01:11:02,280
what do you think of the most important
issues in Britain today

944
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:06,570
number one is immigration the
Conservatives when they were in

945
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:10,950
opposition and that conservatively done
coalition have brought down or sought to

946
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:16,500
bring down the level of immigration from
outside the EU but of course within the

947
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:16,740
EU

948
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:20,400
there is free movement of labour that's
how it works

949
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:25,320
free movement of capital and labor and
so as immigration from outside the US

950
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:30,690
decline immigration from inside the EU
has gone up and this means that from mr

951
01:11:30,690 --> 01:11:33,690
cameron and for other British
politicians it would be so different for

952
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:41,910
the Labour Party frankly they face the
problem that the EU su is tangled up

953
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:47,340
with immigration which is a much more
salient and potent issue even the europe

954
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:52,620
are arguably and so when it comes to
these renegotiations and it's not really

955
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:57,570
mentioned in this long quote the idea
that you know he says in this speech and

956
01:11:57,570 --> 01:12:01,620
the door firm the open to new members
are not absolutely sure to be the door

957
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:05,990
firmly open to new members with the
right to move backwards and forwards

958
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:07,710
across international boundaries but
we'll see

959
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:11,940
very complicated issue with the cut with
the Prime Minister right at the heart of

960
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:13,200
it

961
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:19,440
so the big issues it seems to me with
Europe is what are the issues and

962
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:24,300
history because history in this that lie
believe beneath Britain strained

963
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:28,950
relationship with the EU and my tree
negotiation and an in-out referendum

964
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:34,940
finally sort things out well as I mean
if i can offer a personal view here

965
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:38,780
no I should be doing this too often I
doubt it will ever be finally in British

966
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:42,410
Britain's case even if the were
referendum it's hard to believe it would

967
01:12:42,410 --> 01:12:50,719
be finally and this is just one of those
recurring questions which will probably

968
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:53,930
stay with Britain for a long time to
come

969
01:12:53,930 --> 01:13:01,760
whether or not there is such a
referendum now just finally this is by

970
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:07,520
no means a lot of a full list but you
know in looking ahead to the coming year

971
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:11,449
some of the essays that will need to be
written so on

972
01:13:11,449 --> 01:13:18,919
there are so many institutions and other
rock

973
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:22,700
not all these all institutions in
various ways but all of them are

974
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:25,670
relevant and are being reformed the
heart of the British constitution

975
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:30,830
permanently in flux the lib dems are
discussing it and on and off at their

976
01:13:30,830 --> 01:13:37,160
party comes up in glasgow the role of
the monic regularly disgusting as play

977
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:42,440
showing in the West End about the
imagined early days of King Charles the

978
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:46,339
third the role of the monarch
permanently under debate

979
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,900
perhaps less so with the current Queen
as head of state but it's always an

980
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:52,190
issue for some people

981
01:13:52,190 --> 01:13:57,379
House of Lords very much more as an
issue of current debate should it be

982
01:13:57,380 --> 01:14:01,280
reformed think overwhelmingly there's a
belief that should the difficulty is

983
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:05,210
nobody can think of a an option that
everybody would agree with and therefore

984
01:14:05,210 --> 01:14:07,100
it's hard to do anything

985
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:11,330
House of Commons number of reforms would
be made to the business practices of the

986
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:14,690
House of Commons but not much more than
that you know

987
01:14:14,690 --> 01:14:18,199
could it operate on more modern
procedures well yes

988
01:14:18,199 --> 01:14:23,360
the British legislation that legislative
processes which I'm touched on at all

989
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:27,469
today are complex of there are many
countries we have many more acts of

990
01:14:27,469 --> 01:14:29,300
parliament and we once did

991
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:33,770
and the process itself has been
regularly criticized for being not only

992
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:36,620
obscure but often rushed

993
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:41,660
we now have new processes like the
consideration draft bills and lots of

994
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:42,980
things going on there

995
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:47,599
select committees we talked about the
major political parties what we have you

996
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:48,160
know the

997
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:52,300
served to party the Labour Party in the
liberal democrats are all in there vary

998
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:55,270
in their way and if you see this in the
current opinion polls they are all

999
01:14:55,270 --> 01:15:00,460
unpopular at the same time it's very
unusual to have your three traditional

1000
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:03,640
major parties unpopular the same time

1001
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:08,800
normally you get the government and
popular in the opposition's popular well

1002
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,410
actually all three are in the polls at
the moment

1003
01:15:11,410 --> 01:15:15,580
that's partly because there are
insurgent parties particularly you Kip

1004
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:19,720
but also here in there the greens

1005
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:24,100
so you keep to the right of these three

1006
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:28,120
the Greens to the left of these three
interesting to wonder if they were a

1007
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:32,559
Labour government will find out that
before the end of the academic year just

1008
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:36,550
you know whether the if there were a
Labour government whether the Greens

1009
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:41,890
would become a party a bigger party of
protest if the lib dems didn't fulfill

1010
01:15:41,890 --> 01:15:48,820
that protest the pope didn't have that
job at the time manifestos well we'll be

1011
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:52,990
running into manifesto season the
textual analysis and manifestos and what

1012
01:15:52,990 --> 01:15:55,750
politics government then do with them
always interesting

1013
01:15:55,750 --> 01:16:00,670
lobbyists we've had in the last year
legislation to try to curtail the

1014
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:02,650
activities of lobbyists

1015
01:16:02,650 --> 01:16:05,950
there are many like many many lobbyists
out there now and I don't just mean

1016
01:16:05,950 --> 01:16:09,880
lobbying company's most big companies
have their own in-house lobbyists

1017
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:13,690
there are many companies that do this
some of you may want to go work in such

1018
01:16:13,690 --> 01:16:17,559
companies in years ahead they are an
important element in the political

1019
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:22,270
system and have many interesting people

Downing Street today

the not only about the day-to-day

1034
01:17:16,890 --> 01:17:20,670
workings of Downing Street but some
people about the layout of desks and

1035
01:17:20,670 --> 01:17:26,190
doors in Downing Street how these things
matter to the way power is used in the

1036
01:17:26,190 --> 01:17:33,239
british political system and the
Treasury the all-powerful Treasury at

1037
01:17:33,239 --> 01:17:38,549
the top of the uk's finance ministry and
then finally the sub-national

1038
01:17:38,550 --> 01:17:43,920
institutions not by any means last but
not least which we touched on already

1039
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:49,260
including in London with its
extraordinary Merrill system led by

1040
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:54,120
boris johnson recently selected to
become a parliamentary candidate in the

1041
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:59,190
next general election and then of course
London is the British capital of think

1042
01:17:59,190 --> 01:18:02,309
tanks those of you might just make a
suggestion

1043
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:06,719
want to meet large numbers of
interesting people in the evenings for

1044

1048
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:31,410
I'd avail yourself of them but crucially
they too are a subject worthy of study

1049
01:18:31,410 --> 01:18:32,910
in their own right

1050
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:36,389
their influence on politics these days
